# Game Sharing Tool

A simple game sharing tool that enables sharing of video with coded points of interest.  View the [User Stories](https://github.com/dneimke/coding-tool/wiki) to get an idea of what the tool does.

Unlike other coding tools, this tool is based on the idea of social sharing.  The goal is to allow coded games to be easily shared and copied to grow a pool of metadata around specific games and their points of interest. 

## Getting started
